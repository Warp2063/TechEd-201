  - `<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name" required />`
  - `<input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />`
  - `<input type="submit" value="Submit the Form" />`
  - `input[type="submit"] { padding: 6px; }`
  - there is a form submission event
  - a page refreshes by default during submission, which also clears the console log
  - if you put `event.preventDefault();` in the submission handler, it will prevent the refresh and clearing of the console log
