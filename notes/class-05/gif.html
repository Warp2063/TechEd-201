    <h1>GIF - The Graphics Interchange Format</h1>
    <br />

    <p>
      GIF is an image format that came out in 1987, developed by a team at
      CompuServe, with the latest standard being released in 1989. CompuServe
      was looking for a new, small but lossless graphics format for their
      service, capable of working on many different computer systems. As an
      earlier web graphics standard, it is somewhat limited in its ability to
      reproduce color, as it only supports a palette of 256 colors (selectable
      from the full 24-bit color space). This makes it ill-suited for
      reproducing wide varieties of color in a single image, but helps to keep
      the file size small, which suited the early internet well with its limited
      data transmission rates. Another nice feature was support for animations.
      These features and limitations make GIF files best for things like logos.
      However, compared to more modern graphics standards, it is quite large and
      slow to load.
