## Notes

When a client comes to you with a task:

- Collect **User Stories**, or Ideas to find use cases from different types of users.
- Rank the importance of the different features defined by the User Stories
- Select the most important features  
  
- **Padding** is the space between the **border** and the content.
- **Margin** is the space between the **border** and neighboring content's margin.
