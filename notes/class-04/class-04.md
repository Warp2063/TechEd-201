- CSS positioning, cont.
- **Viewport** - The portion of the page that can be seen on-screen.
- Relative & Absolute, Fixed & Sticky, Static
- Every element is ```static``` by default, and has no definable position.
- ```relative``` is relative to the page.
  - The page has a top and left but is infinite to the bottom and right, so defining relative to bottom or right makes no sense and does not work.
- ```fixed``` elements are relative to the viewport.
  - The viewport has a finite and known top, bottom, left, and right, so you can define the element's position in relation to these.
