- HTMLCanvas is an old method of web art and animation
- A-Frame is a newer framework to help with animation in canvas.
- CSS-effects
  - Transformations are different than positions. Adjusting position from its original placement vs placing.
  - in css:
    - `transform: rotate(90deg);`
    - `transform: rotateX(90deg);` rotates around the X axis, will turn a flat object invisible since its apparent height will be zero.
    - `transform: translate(20px, 20px);` Move 20 px on X and 20 px on Y
    - `transform: scale(2.1);` scales it by 2.1x
  - Transitions
    - `transition: width 2s;` changes width over 2 seconds
  - Animations
    - `animation-name` must come before the template.
