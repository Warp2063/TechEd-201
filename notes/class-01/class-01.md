During class, I created a simple page using prompts (sans error checking) to demonstrate competency in getting inputs via browser prompts, and updating list contents based on the inputs.
  
### Labs

- [lab-01b.md](/code/lab-01b/lab-01b.md)
  - Use an event listener and handler on a button to get inputs via prompts to the user.
  - Change inner HTML and style based on the inputs.
- [lab-01b.html](/code/lab-01b/lab-01b.html)
  - Version 1

## Other

- [sampleColorDemo.html](/code/other/sampleColorDemo.html)
  - With zero error checking, takes a color for the foreground and the background and applies them.
  - Not sure if this was a lab.
- [colorDemo2.html](/code/other/colorDemo2.html)
  - An onmouseenter listener watches for that as input, and cycles through some predefined display colors.
  - An onmouseleave listener returns the colors to normal.
