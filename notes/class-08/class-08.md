- Objects!
  - `var obj = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"}`
  - The above has two properties, `firstName` and `lastName`, accessible as `obj.firstName` and `obj.lastName`
  - Often recommend using keyword `const` instead of var. Does not prevent changing of the properties within. So, if `const` is used when declaring and assigning the initial object, `obj = {firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe"}` will produce an error, but `obj.firstName = "Jane"` will not.
