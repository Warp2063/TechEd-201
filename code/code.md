# Project Reference Guide

This is a quick reference of all the projects and the functionality they contain, in the hopes that it will be easier to find pages and code snippets later on.

## Lab 01a

This was originally a demonstration of Git. However, I wrote a short webpage within.

- Click a button to prompt for a name and applies it to the inner HTML.
- Click another button to cycle through a set of preset colors.

## Lab 01b

This is the beginning of a series of tasks where the user clicks a button to be prompted for several pieces of biographical information.

- Also sets color of the text based upon the question asking for favorite color
- [Lab-01b More info](./lab-01b/lab-01b.md)

## sampleColorDemo

There are two buttons that a user can press. One prompts the user for a color for the text, and one prompts the user for a color for the background. There is no error checking.

## colorDemo2

Changes the color of text and its background when you hover over the text. It cycles through a preset sequence of colors.

---

## Lab 02a

Extends Lab 01b by adding a second button, which when clicked will prompt the user for a series of user preference information.

## arrayPush

It accepts prompts when a button is pressed, adding students to an array. It also has a special response for a specific input.

- [arrayPush.html](./other/arrayPush.html)

---

## Lab 02b

A number guessing game. I'd actually written one for fun back in TechEd 102, which I completely rewrote.

## photosite

Some CSS practice, trying to build a photo gallery webpage.

## Lab? Task? 04

Simple page with no frills that demonstrates ideal naming of setters and getter functions.

- [Lab-04](/code/lab-04/p04.html)

---

## Lab 05

Functionally the same as lab-02a, this lab put more focus on CSS positioning, with a side emphasis on making things look good. Due to struggles with CSS positioning, I chose to limit the page to 1000px wide in order to alleviate struggles with dynamic resizing. I also took the oppportunity to begin exploring objects and also used Maps, observing the differences in iterating through key-value pairings in for loops.

## Lab 06

Cycles colors, text, and uppercase/lowercase. Demonstrates programatic manipulation of the DOM via innerHTML in JavaScript, inserting elements and adjusting both their text and CSS color styling upon each button click. Also demonstrates usage of both innerText and innerHTML.

- [Lab-06](/code/lab-06/lab-06.md)

---

## Table

Just a quick demonstration of a table in HTML with some CSS styling.

- [table.html](/code/table.html)

---

## Lab 07

Uses DOM tree manipulation to add additional table rows when a user clicks a button, prompting inputs. Also did work on CSS Positioning to try to make a dynamically-resizeable page, with some success. Manually added pointer styling to CSS and event listeners for fun.

- [Lab-07](/code/lab-07/lab-07.md)

## objectDemo

Simple demonstration of an object with nested objects.
