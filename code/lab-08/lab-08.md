# Lab 07

## Task

Evolving from [Lab-07 "Salmon Cookies"](/code/lab-05/lab-05.md)

1. Change the css positioning to css flex box
2. Header may be either fixed or movable.

## Additional Features

I add the CSS pointer property to each City name, and also add an event listener for it for when it's clicked, bringing up an alert with information pulled from that row of the table.

Attempts at responsive design, changing the layout as the screen size changes. Still incomplete.

## Version 1

```html
something
```
