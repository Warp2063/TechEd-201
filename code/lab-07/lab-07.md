# Lab 07

## Task

Evolving from [Lab-05](/code/lab-05/lab-05.md)

Also, improve on the responsiveness of the page when it's resized.

1. When a button is clicked we should get four prompts -> city, min-customers, max-customers, cookies-sold
2. Now this data should be displayed in the table
3. The table should contain four columns -> city, min-customers, max-customers, cookies-sold.

## Additional Features

I add the CSS pointer property to each City name, and also add an event listener for it for when it's clicked, bringing up an alert with information pulled from that row of the table.

## Version 1

```html
something
```
